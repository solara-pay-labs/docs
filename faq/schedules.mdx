## Payroll Schedules

### What are Payroll Schedules in Solara Pay?  
Payroll Schedules allow users to automate recurring payments to recipients within a Payroll Group. Instead of manually disbursing payments each time, you can set up a schedule to handle payouts automatically at specific intervals.  

### What schedule options are available?  
Solara Pay supports four scheduling options:  

- **Hourly** – Payments are sent every hour.  
- **Daily** – Payments are processed once per day.  
- **Weekly** – Payments are disbursed once a week.  
- **Monthly** – Payments occur once per month.  

### Can I edit or cancel a Payroll Schedule?  
Yes, you can modify or cancel a scheduled payroll at any time. However, changes will only affect future disbursements. Any payments already processed cannot be reversed.  

### Will recipients receive notifications for scheduled payrolls?  
Yes, once a scheduled payment is processed, the recipient will receive a notification serving as a receipt, confirming that the funds have been sent.  

### What happens if my wallet doesn’t have enough funds?  
If your wallet lacks sufficient funds at the scheduled time, the payment will not be processed, additionaly the payroll group status will change to inactive, and you'll receive an alert prompting you to top up your balance.
