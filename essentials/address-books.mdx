## What is the Address Book?  

The [**Address Book**](https://solarapay.fun/dashboard/address-books) in Solara Pay is a centralized place where you can store and manage frequently used wallet addresses. Instead of entering recipient wallet addresses manually each time you process a payroll, the Address Book allows you to **save, edit, and reuse addresses** for seamless disbursements.  

## Adding a New Address

    2. Click the **"Add New Address"** button.  
    3. Enter the recipientâ€™s **name**, **wallet address**, **email**, **department** and **network** for easy identification.  
    4. Click **Save**, and the address will be available for future transactions.

## Editing or Removing an Address  

- To **edit** an existing address, locate it in your Address Book and click the **Edit** button. Update the details and save your changes.  
- To **delete** an address, simply click **Remove**, and it will no longer be available in your list.  

The Address Book helps eliminate errors from manual entry and speeds up payroll processing, making disbursements more efficient.
