## Overview  

Solara Pay simplifies bulk payments through **Payroll Groups**, allowing businesses to send funds to multiple recipients in a single transaction. This feature is ideal for **salaries, contractor payments, and bulk disbursements**.

## What is a Payroll Group?  

A **Payroll Group** is a collection of recipients who receive payments together. This feature helps businesses:  
- **Streamline payroll processes** by organizing recipients into predefined groups.  
- **Save time** by making a single disbursement instead of multiple individual transactions.  
- **Reduce errors** by ensuring payments are sent to the correct recipients.  

## Viewing & Managing Payroll Groups  

To **view or add recipients** to a Payroll Group:  
1. **Go to the Payroll Page**.  
2. Locate your preferred **Payroll Group**.  
3. Find the **Eye Icon (üëÅÔ∏è)** and click on it.  
4. You‚Äôll be redirected to the **Payroll Recipient Page**, where you can manage recipients.  

## Managing Payroll Recipients  

### Adding Recipients  

1. Click **"Add Recipient"** on the **Payroll Recipient Page**.  
2. Enter the recipient‚Äôs details, including:  
   - **Name**  
   - **Wallet Address** (for Solana transactions)  
   - **Preferred Currency** (e.g., USDC, SOL)  
   - **Schedule** (Hourly, Daily, Weekly & Monthly)
3. Click **Save** to add the recipient to the group.  

### Editing or Removing Recipients  

Some actions are represented by **icons** for quick access:  
- **Edit (‚úèÔ∏è Pen Icon)** ‚Üí Modify recipient details.  
- **Delete/Remove (üóëÔ∏è Trash Bin Icon)** ‚Üí Remove a recipient from the group.  

‚ö†Ô∏è *Removing a recipient from a Payroll Group does not delete their transaction history.*  

## Making Payroll Disbursements  

Once a **Payroll Group** is set up, and active, we would automatically disburse this payroll according to the Schedule.
This means if you have a recipient you'd like to pay 10 USDC per hour, 10 USDC will be sent to them every hour. When your balance runs low, we will automatically pause the Payroll Group and send you an email notification to remind you to top up your account.

Each recipient will receive their payment instantly, with the transaction recorded in the **Payments page**.  

## Conclusion  

The **Payroll Group & Recipients** feature helps businesses automate payments efficiently while reducing manual work. By setting up Payroll Groups, users can **quickly disburse funds**, track transactions, and manage recipients with ease.
